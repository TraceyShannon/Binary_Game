# Binary Game

This is a simple game that was easier than I thought to build but enough of me patting myself on the back. This game is a math game that is specifically designed to be a mobile game. It's completely mobile responsive and fun to play if you enjoy computer science related games, which I assume you do maybe.

This app is designed to be built upon with different concepts to build other more complicated works that are a little more useful. Such as mortgage calculators, child brain development games, survey's and other applications.
